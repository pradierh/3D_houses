- [X] to be able to present a final product

## Description


## Installation

```
sudo pip install numpy pandas geopandas matplotlib geopy folium fiona shapely rasterio earthpy open3d PyQt5 mayavi jupyterlab rioxarray
```
for jupyterlab, if you are using a Unix derivative (FreeBSD, GNU / Linux, OS X), you can achieve this by using:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Usage
Navigate to the repo root on your terminal then write this command line:
